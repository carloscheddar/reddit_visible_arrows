# Reddit Visible Arrows

This chrome extension enables voting arrows regardless of the CSS that the subreddit uses. This also works for subreddits that require subscriptions to enable voting.

## Install
You can either install via the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ehakajcimcpgbaebammmaaacfmnmefjd) or clone this repo and [load the extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

## Issues
While I used a CSS selector that should work with every subreddit there may be some that block this implementation. If so feel free to submit a PR with a fix or create an issue and I'll modify the selector accordingly.
