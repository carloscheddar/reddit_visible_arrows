# Reddit Visible Arrows

This chrome extension enables voting arrows regardless of the CSS that the subreddit uses. This also works for subreddits that require subscriptions to enable voting.

## Issues
While I used a CSS selector that should work with every subreddit there may be some that block this implementation. If so feel free to submit a PR with a fix or create an issue and I'll modify the selector accordingly.
