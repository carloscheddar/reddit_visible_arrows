# Reddit Visible Arrows

This extension enables voting arrows regardless of the CSS that the subreddit uses. This also works for subreddits that require subscriptions to enable voting.

## Installation
- [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ehakajcimcpgbaebammmaaacfmnmefjd)
- [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reddit-visible-arrows/)
- [Load from source](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)

## Issues
While I used a CSS selector that should work with every subreddit there may be some that block this implementation. If so feel free to submit a PR with a fix or create an issue and I'll modify the selector accordingly.

## Disclaimer
This extension resets the arrow positioning making subs like [/r/ShitRedditSays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/) seem like the arrows are inverted.
This happens because some subs modify the sprites of the arrows making upvotes look like downvotes and viceversa.
